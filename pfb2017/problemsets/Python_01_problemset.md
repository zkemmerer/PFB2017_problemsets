Python 1 Problem Set
==================
 

1. Start up the Python Interactive Interpreter. Print out "Hello New York"
2. Store your name in a variable and print the contents of this variable.
3. Use nano to write a script. Make sure to include `# !/usr/bin/python3` at the top!! 
   - The script should print out, your name, favorite color, favorite activity, and your favorite animal.  
   - Make it executable using `chmod` (only have to do this one time per script).
   - Run it from the command line. 
4. Use PyCharm to write the same script.
   - Make it executable
   - Run it from the command line.
5. Use `sys.argv` (make sure to import sys!!!) to store and retrieve 2 varibles that you print to the screen.
6. Make sure to keep your remote repository synced with your local repo. (ADD/COMMIT/PUSH)
